WARNING! :: THIS PROJECT IS STILL NOWHERE NEAR BEING READY!
( AT THIS TIME, IT'S STILL MUCH LIKE A SOFTWARE EQUIVALENT TO A PAPERWEIGHT )

must have the following dependencies:
- a C compiler compatible with the C89 standard
(any C compiler whatsoever ought to work for this, but i recommend GCC or Clang)
- a POSIX-compliant implementation of 'make'

if you are on a unix-like system just run 'make', then 'make install'.

if you are not on a unix-like system, run 'make', then copy the executable file
into your desired directory

if 'make' is unavailable, you may run the following commands :
        cc -O3 -ansi -pedantic -Wall -c main.c -o main.o
        cc -O3 -ansi -pedantic -Wall -c error.c -o error.o
        cc -O3 -ansi -pedantic -Wall -c file.c -o file.o
        cc -O3 -ansi -pedantic -Wall -c command.c -o command.o
        cc -O3 -ansi -Wall main.o error.o file.o command.o -o bysc

i guess the process is really straight foreward, but we should all be thankful,
because that's a good thing
