Why?
Because I have no reason to assume that nobody has the capacity or the will to modify or compile this program onto a network-attached system as a way of circumventing their obligations to disclose the source code to this program or their modifications of it, or to disclose that it's even being used.
I'm looking at you, Google. You don't get to have the brownie points of calling your programs "free software" if you are not willing to fulfill any of the obligations that would involve defending the very same rights of other users that you are currently enjoying as a developer.

I feel it would be prudent to give everyone here a quick recap of their rights as users.

First and foremost, all users have the right to run and interact with all computer programs as they choose, which means that if you do not wish to interact with this program, you have the right to information regarding scenarios where you might interact with it, so as to avoid doing so. If this program is licensed under the GPL instead, network-attached systems and programs that interface with them would not be obligated to conspicuously advise you that this program is utilized in their work, nor would they be obligated to conspicuously disclose the source.

Second, as the original author of this program, I want you to have the same rights to modifications of this code as the rights I am providing here. I wish for all users of this program to be in full command of rights to the program and the source code here, as such you are also entitled to the release of any publicly disclosed modifications. Google may disagree, but in my opinion as a developer, releasing public access to this program or its functions DOES constitute publication, even if the executable binaries are not distributed. Furthermore, I feel you are entitled to compile, run, and modify the code enclosed here, and all published modifications. Which means that as you are entitled to the code I am providing here, you are also entitled to the source code of any and all network-attached modifications that are accessible to the public, even if the public may only interact with them via data transferred through networking protocols. If you wish to have a network-attached version of this program for your own purposes, like with mastodon, then you have every right to it, just as you have every right to this program. Having this code under the GPL would mean that you may never actually have access to that code or the binaries on which network-attached solutions are executed because of a loophole created by a technicality surrounding only the distribution of executable binaries, such that the obligation would not apply to network-attached solutions. Even if they do choose to publish the code, the GPL doesn't obligate them to do so. The only guarantee you have as a user to the rights that we enjoy as developers is by enforcing obligations on the part of developers to respect, defend, and propagate these rights for all to enjoy.

If Google tries to tell you otherwise, tell them to shove it.

## Commands
The following commands are listed as macros in 'bysc.h'. If you wish to alter the commands in your program, edit them in that file, and your changes will take effect in your copy upon compilation.
